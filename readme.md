outline:

	who am i
	preface about how vuex was hard for me
	why? because i didnt get when and where to use it
	its usage itself - simple
	but *when* it made sense i struggled with

	Vuex definitions
		store, etc

	Adding Vuex to a project





State Mgmt:
	Solves a problem you may not have!
	One component, one set of data = easy
	Two components, two set of data = mostly easy
	Many components, one set of data = um....

Vuex:
	(Another) library for Vue (deeply integrated)
	https://vuex.vuejs.org/
	"Store"
	Components can read from the store
	Components cannot change data in the store (directly)

Parts of Vuex
	State
	Mutations
	Getters
	Actions
	Modules
